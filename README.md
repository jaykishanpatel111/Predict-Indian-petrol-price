# Predict-Indian-petrol-price
We have taken the Indian petrol price dataset in this deep learning project. Using this dataset to predict the future petrol price in Kolkata.  We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, we perform a LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) model. We got 99% accuracy. The difference between the actual petrol price and the predicted petrol price is 0.028â‚¹.
